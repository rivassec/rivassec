### 🧰 Toolbox

- 🖥️ Infrastructure: AWS, EKS, Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation
- 🔐 Security: IAM, RBAC, FIPS, CIS Benchmarks, Zero Trust
- ⚙️ Tooling: Trivy, Checkov, Vault, CrowdStrike, GitHub Actions
- 📦 Languages: Python, Bash, YAML (heavy user), a bit of Go

### 🚧 Current Focus

- Hardening AWS and Kubernetes environments at scale  
- Building policy-as-code pipelines for compliance and audit readiness  
- Creating DevSecOps tooling to close the gap between security and velocity  
- Aligning FedRAMP/SOC2 controls with infrastructure code and CI/CD

### 📌 Projects

- **[secure-iam-lint](https://github.com/rivassec/secure-iam-lint)**  
  Lints AWS IAM policies for insecure patterns and overly broad access.  
  Lightweight, extensible, and security-team friendly.

- **iam-lint-remediate** *(coming soon)*  
  A companion tool to suggest (or apply) safer alternatives to risky IAM policy statements.

- **eks-rbac-audit** *(in progress)*  
  A Python tool for auditing Kubernetes RBAC roles for privilege escalation risks.

> 🧭 Security isn’t a feature — it’s infrastructure.

All tools are built with reproducibility, clarity, and operational scale in mind.
