# Staff Security Engineer - Cloud & Platform Security

I build and ship security controls in public: an AWS IAM blast-radius
analyzer with a live tool, a Pulumi IAM library with safe defaults, and
a threat-model addendum for the case where the operator is the adversary.

Current role (private org work under [@oliveratprimer](https://github.com/oliveratprimer),
low public signal): AWS and EKS hardening in production, detection and
response on CrowdStrike Falcon and GuardDuty, and SOC 2 / ISO 27001 /
CMMC requirements mapped into policy-as-code in CI/CD.

* [`iam-safe-defaults`](https://github.com/rivassec/iam-safe-defaults) - Pulumi component library for AWS IAM with safe defaults that fail loud: mandatory permissions boundary, no wildcard trust, every opt-out explicit. 📝 [IAM Roles That Fail Loud](https://rivassec.com/iam-safe-defaults-fail-loud.html)
* [`weaponization-threat-model`](https://github.com/rivassec/weaponization-threat-model) - One-page addendum to STRIDE/LINDDUN/PASTA for modeling the legitimate operator as the adversary. 📝 Applied in [When Telemetry Turns Predatory](https://rivassec.com/telemetry-turns-predatory.html)
