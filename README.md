### 📌 Featured Projects

- **[`secure-iam-lint`](https://github.com/rivassec/secure-iam-lint)**
  CLI tool that scans AWS IAM policies for insecure patterns.
  Used to prevent privilege escalation before code reaches production.

- **[`eks-rbac-audit`](https://github.com/rivassec/eks-rbac-audit)** *(in progress)*
  Analyzes Kubernetes RBAC roles to catch overly broad permissions.

- **[`cf-token-links`](https://github.com/rivassec/cf-token-links)**
  Flask microservice for generating time-limited access links with usage tracking.
  Designed for recruiters, profile sharing, and ephemeral resource access.

- **[`tw-disinfo-defense`](https://github.com/rivassec/tw-disinfo-defense)**
  A suite of scripts designed to research disinformation behavior on Twitter using OAuth-based automation.

- **[`efi-bruteforce`](https://github.com/rivassec/efi-bruteforce)**
  A historical exploration of USB-based EFI input automation on macOS.
  Featured on [Hackaday in 2013](https://hackaday.com/2013/02/26/mac-efi-pin-lock-brute-force-attack-unsuccessful/) as early research into firmware security.
